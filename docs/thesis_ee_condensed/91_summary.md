This thesis designs, implements, and validates an end-to-end low-latency system for real-time cryptocurrency market data processing and machine-learning-based price movement prediction. The work is motivated by the practical gap between exchange-specific data interfaces and production-grade prediction pipelines, and by the latency and operational overhead of common streaming stacks (e.g., Kafka-based solutions) when building deterministic, reproducible experimentation environments.

The system is implemented as a polyglot monorepo (TypeScript, Python, Rust) with a service-oriented architecture separating concerns across three deployable services: **external-bridge** for data ingestion from Binance and Kraken via REST and WebSockets, **internal-bridge** for platform-specific normalization and stream reconciliation, and **py-predictor** for feature generation, model training, and live inference. Persistence is built on RocksDB (including primary/secondary access for concurrent write/read use-cases), while inter-process streaming uses ZeroMQ to enable low-latency publish/subscribe communication and deterministic offline replay.

Key results include an empirical comparison of messaging approaches where the RocksDB+ZeroMQ design achieved substantially lower end-to-end latency than a Kafka baseline in a 1,000,000-message benchmark (median ~8.4 ms vs ~26.4 ms). For Python-side high-frequency feature computation, a custom lock-free ring buffer outperformed `multiprocessing.Queue` by ~3.6–5.3× for message passing, while a structure-of-arrays memory layout enabled efficient NumPy vectorized computations. The machine learning workflow introduces a greedy iterative feature selection algorithm that reduces an otherwise combinatorial search (e.g., \(C(50,7)\approx 99\) million combinations) to an approximately linear evaluation budget (~1,750 trials for typical settings). Experiments on ETH_USDT (Kraken, Oct–Nov 2024) indicate that compact feature sets (2–4 feature groups) can outperform baseline models trained on 50+ features; for example, the best iterative configurations achieved a score of 0.0933 for `target_high_up_0.09p` and 0.6640 for `target_high_up_0.29p`, while full-feature baselines often collapsed to majority-class predictions.

For live predictions, the thesis proposes a Mixture-of-Experts-inspired ensemble strategy: specialists are selected by empirical precision for negative and positive classes, aggregated via majority voting, and synthesized into actionable directional signals (“up”, “down”, “volatile”, “stable”) across multiple thresholds. However, the author did not manage to finalize the full live prediction system; at the current stage it runs only as a CLI command in simulation mode. The work concludes that low-latency, reproducible market-data-to-prediction pipelines can be achieved on a single machine with careful storage/IPC design, and that systematic feature sparsity can be more valuable than increasing model complexity under limited positive-event regimes.

Limitations include evaluation on a single symbol and primarily one exchange context, the live prediction system being available only as a CLI simulation, and the absence of a live trading integration. Future work should productionize the live inference pipeline, extend validation across multiple assets and venues, add backtesting with realistic transaction costs, stress-test robustness under varied market regimes, and explore scaling the architecture beyond a single-node deployment.
